CAUTION: See the notes under <<opensearch-prerequisites,OpenSearch Prerequisites>>

[#system-requirements]
== System Requirements

To run this demo, your system needs at least:

* 6.5 {k8s-cpu}[cpu units] (core/hyperthread)
* 5GiB memory
* 27GiB disk storage

[#opensearch-prerequisites]
=== OpenSearch prerequisites

==== MacOS and Windows

If you use MacOS or Windows and use Docker to run Kubernetes, set the RAM to at least 4 GB in _Preferences > Resources_.

==== Linux

OpenSearch uses a mmapfs directory by default to store its indices. The default operating system limits on mmap counts
are likely too low - usually 65530, which may result in out-of-memory exceptions. So, the Linux setting
`vm.max_map_count` on the host machine where "kind" is running must be set to at least 262144.

To check the current value, run this command:

[source,console]
----
$ sysctl vm.max_map_count
----

The limit can be temporarily increased with:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo sysctl --write vm.max_map_count=262144
----

To permanently increase the value, add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

[source,.properties]
----
vm.max_map_count=262144
----

Then run `sudo sysctl --load` to reload.

== Overview

This demo will

* Install the required Stackable operators.
* Spin up the following data products:
** *Apache ZooKeeper*: A centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed
   synchronization, and providing group services. This demo makes its log data observable in OpenSearch Dashboards.
** *Vector*: A tool for building observability pipelines. This demo uses Vector as a log agent to gather and transform
   the logs and as an aggregator to forward the collected logs to OpenSearch.
** *OpenSearch*: A data store and search engine. This demo uses it to store and index the of the log data.
** *OpenSearch Dashboards*: A visualization and user interface. This demo uses it to make the log data easily accessible
   to the user.
* Create a view in OpenSearch Dashboards for convenient browsing the log data.

You can see the deployed products and their relationship in the following diagram:

== List the deployed Stackable services

To list the installed Stackable services run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stacklet list

== Inspect the Log Data

You can have a look at the log data within the OpenSearch Dashboards web interface by running
`stackablectl stacklet list` and opening the URL in the opensearch-dashboard entry's info column. In this case, it is
http://172.18.0.2:30595.

image::logging/login.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

NOTE: On first login, you will be presented with some options. Feel free to bypass them to get to the logs.

Click _Discovery_ in the menu to view the recent logs. If you do not see anything, increase the search window to greater than _Last 15 minutes_.

From here you can inspect the logs. You can select fields on the left side to limit the view to interesting information.
