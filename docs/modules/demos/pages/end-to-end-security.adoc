This is a demo to showcase what can be done with Open Policy Agent around authorization in the Stackable Data Platform.
It covers the following aspects of security:

* Column- and row-level filtering
* OIDC support across the board
* Kerberos on Kubernetes
* Keycloak and flexible group lookup
* Open Policy Agent for the utmost flexibility in building access rules

across this tech stack:

* Trino
* Superset
* HDFS


Install this demo on an existing Kubernetes cluster:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo install end-to-end-security

== Overview

You can see the deployed products and their relationship in the following diagram:

Please note the different types of arrows used to connect the technologies in here, which symbolize
how authentication happens along that route and if impersonation is used for queries executed.

The Trino schema (with schemas, tables and views) is shown below.

// the svg does not have a specified size, so we need to size it here or it will be 0x0

=== User credentials

The following user accounts are configured in Keycloak:

=== Ruleset

The rules that are configured in this demo show different options of giving full or restricted access to data with OPA.

==== General Access Control
At the highest level, everybody is allowed to see data from the schema of the department they are a member of.
So in the following example, Justin Martin, who is a member of the Customer Service department will only be
able to see tables from the Customer Service schema.

==== Column-based Access Control

Sophia Clarke from the Compliance department can see tables for the Compliance department, but has also been given
restricted access to the customers table.

The following diagram shows which rules are in place, you can easily test these with a sql editor of your chice.

==== Row-level Access Control
Access control at the row level has been implemented on the employee table, where everybody can see information
about themselves, as well as people who report to them.
