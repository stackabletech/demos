## Pre-Release Demo Testing

Part of <https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/TRACKING_ISSUE>

This is testing:

1. That upgrades from the outgoing _stable_ release to the new release of the operators and products do
   not negatively impact the products.
2. That the new release demos work as documented from scratch.

### Outgoing Stable to new YY.M Upgrade Testing Instructions

These instructions are for deploying and completing the outgoing stable demo, and then
upgading operators, CRDs, and products to the nightly versions well as upgrading
the operators and CRDS.

<!--
    Make sure to update the YY.M.X and YY.M versions mentioned below when creating the issue.
-->

> [!TIP]
> Be sure to select the _stable_ docs version on <https://docs.stackable.tech/home/stable/demos/>.

```shell
# Install demo (stable operators) for the stable release (YY.M).
# Until https://github.com/stackabletech/stackable-cockpit/issues/310 is merged,
# this will need to be done by pointing stackablectl to local files checked out
# from the outgoing stable release branch.
git checkout release-OUTGOING_STABLE
git pull
stackablectl --stack-file=stacks/stacks-v2.yaml --demo-file=demos/demos-v2.yaml demo install <DEMO_NAME>

# --- IMPORTANT ---
# Run through the stable demo instructions (refer to the tasklist above).

# Get a list of installed operators
stackablectl operator installed --output=plain

# --- OPTIONAL ---
# Sometimes it is necessary to upgrade Helm charts. Look for other Helm Charts
# which might need updating.

# First, see which charts are installed. You can ignore the stackable-operator
# charts, or anything that might have been installed outside of this demo.
helm list

# Next, add the applicable Helm Chart repositories. For example:
helm repo add minio https://charts.min.io/
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

# Finally, upgrade the Charts to what is defined in `main`.
# For example:
helm upgrade minio minio/minio --version x.x.x
helm upgrade postgresql-hive bitnami/postgresql --version x.x.x
# --- OPTIONAL END ---

# Uninstall operators for the stable release (OUTGOING_STABLE)
stackablectl release uninstall OUTGOING_STABLE

# At this point, we assume release.yml has been updated with the new YY.M release.
# if it hasn't, you will need to point stackablectl at a locally updated file using --release-file

# Update CRDs to nightly version (on release-YY.M)
# Repeat this for every operator used by the demo (use the list from the earlier step before deleting the operators)
kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/commons-operator/release-YY.M/deploy/helm/commons-operator/crds/crds.yaml
kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/...-operator/release-YY.M/deploy/helm/...-operator/crds/crds.yaml

# Install new release operators (use the list from the earlier step before deleting the operators)
stackablectl operator install commons=YY.M ...

# Optionally update the product versions in the CRDs (to the latest non-experimental version for the new release), e.g.:
kubectl patch hbaseclusters/hbase --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/image/productVersion", "value":"x.x.x"}]' # changed
```

### YY.M from Scratch Testing Instructions

These instructions are for deploying and completing the YY.M demo from scratch.

<!--
    Make sure to update the version mentioned below when creating the issue.
-->

> [!TIP]
> Be sure to select the _nightly_ docs version on <https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/demos/>.

```shell
# Install demo (stable operators) for the nightly release.
# Until https://github.com/stackabletech/stackable-cockpit/issues/310 is merged,
# this will need to be done by pointing stackablectl to local files checked out
# from the release-YY.M branch.
git checkout release-YY.M
git pull
stackablectl --stack-file=stacks/stacks-v2.yaml --demo-file=demos/demos-v2.yaml demo install <DEMO_NAME>

# --- IMPORTANT ---
# Run through the nightly demo instructions (refer to the tasklist above).
```
