A demo is an end-to-end demonstration of the usage of the Stackable data platform. It is tied to a specific stack of the
Stackable data platform, which will provide the required products for the demo. The list of demos can be browsed either
via our documentation page [here][demo-overview] or with the `demo list` command of our `stackablectl` tool. More
information about this command can be found [here][demo-cmd].

A stack is a collection of ready-to-use Stackable data products as well as required third-party services like Postgresql
or MinIO. It is tied to a specific release of the Stackable data platform, which will provide the required operators for
the stack. Stacks can be listed using the `stack list` command, see [here][stack-cmd] for more information.
